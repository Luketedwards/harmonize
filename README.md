# Project Mission Statement
I developed harmonise as a social media platform aimed at making collaboration between musicians more streamlined and providing a focussed community for likeminded individuals. My main aims were at creating a platform where users could advertise musical projects that they were interested in creating, to individuals suited to their goal. The app would then provide a simple way to communuicate with other project members both individually and as a group, and allow them to share files and other documents relevant to their projects.

##  User Experience (UX)
---
### User Stories

- As a first time user I want to:

1. Quickly understand the purpose and layout of the site.
2. Understand how to create a profile and navigate the sites functionality.
3. Be able to customise my profile.

- As a returning visitor I want to:

1. Be able to create and edit musical projects and advertise them to relevant site members.
2. Be able to find projects relevant to my skills and interests, and then apply to join them.
3. Be able to communicate with other members/users on the site.
4. Be able to share sheet music, MP3's and other relevant files to project members.
5. Be able to view other members personal profiles, and follow them to build a community.
6. Be notified of any actions on the site relevant to me (direct messages, new followers etc.)

## 1. Strategy
---
## Project purpose
- To provide a streamlined platform for musicians to communicate and collaborate.
- create a tool for useful files to be easilly shared between users.
- create a social environment for likeminded musicians to be able to discover each other based on a variety of parameters (instrument, genre, location etc.) and also follow one anothers accounts.

## 2. Scope
---
- I wanted a simple and intuitive user experience.
- I wanted all content to be displayed in a slick and aesthetic manner.
- I wanted to incorporate many aspects common to social media platforms (direct messaging, groups, followers, search function, notifications, personal profiles etc.)
- I wanted an intuitive interface to upload and securely store project files in the cloud.
- I wanted a slick looking experience that functions well on a variety of screen sizes.

## 3. Structure
---
- The site features a comprehensive navigation bar which allows the user to easilly traverse the entire sites functionality.
- The sites notification system is built into the navbar with a icon that updates according to new notifications.
- The sites functionality is split accross several drop-down tabs:

    1. An autocompleting search bar to allow the user to find another user by their username
    2. Notifications drop-down that updates with alerts of virtually any action on the website that is of concern to the user (direct message, comment, follow, apllications to a project, the results of an application made by the user, new followers etc.)
    The notifications all feature contextual icons to quickly convey what type it is, and also act as links to instantly traverse the user to the appropriate location.
    3. A projects tab which allows the user to create new projects, browse other projects (either all of them, or only those relevant to them), manage your own projects, and view projects that the user is a member of. Any project that a user is a member of will allow the user to view the 'project hub' for that project, allowing them to view all other members, important information about the project, a group chat, and the ability to both upload or download projects files.
    4. An account section which allows the user access to their own profile in which they can change and update their information, and change their profile picture, and also a 'delete profile' tab which allows the user to remove their profile and all data about them from the site.
    5. A users tab which provides the ability to either view all site members, or view only those fitting certain search criteria.
    6. A connections tab which displays the profiles and information of accounts which are either following or followed by the user.
    7. A messages tab which displays a list of all conversations the user has, and allows access to a direct messaging function.

## 5. Surface

### Colour Scheme

The main colors used in developing the site are a vivid green for the navbar, footer and buttons, yellow for much of the project panels.

### Typography

I used 'Open Sans' for all of the heading throughout the site, 'Source Serif Pro' for the logo and 'Helvetic Neue'. These were backed up by 'Sans Serif'.


### Imagery and Theme

Imagery used throughout the site acts mainly as a backdrop for the page content. I stuck closely with the music theme, making use of images of musicians, and sheet music throughout.

# Testing User Stories from the User Experience (UX) Section
- As a first time user I want to:

1. Q.  Quickly understand the purpose and layout of the game
      * The website features a very streamlined and simple navigation bar that quickly allows users to access a clear set of game instructions. The game itself is also well equipped with user messages, buttons with contextual text, and informative pop-ups and modals.

2. Q. Understand how to play the game
      * The game features access to both a clear instructions page which detail exactly how to play the game, and also a very in-depth resource that both explains the techniques needed to beat the game and also allows users to generate the necessary tools to win.

3. Q .Receive tips and guidance on how to improve my score
      * The "Memory Tips" page both gives a comprehensive history of the techniques of memorisation, along with detailed instructions as to how the user can quickly improve their memory. This page also has a tool that allows the user to generate their own PAO system and save it to their computer. The ability to play at differing difficulty levels, and to track previous scores also aid the player in improving their scores.

- As a returning visitor I want to:

1. Q. Have different levels of difficulty to challenge myself
      * The game features three seperate dificulty levels. Easy: 10 cards, Medium: 25 cards, Hard: 52 cards.

2. Q. Have a system to track my previous score so that I can try and improve my skill
      * The game has a "Previous Scores" button that saves the users previous efforts to local storage for them to keep track of their last attempt across browser sessions.

3. Q. Have tools to help me develop a method to learn the skills of memorisation
      * The "Memory Tips" page contains both detailed historical information surrounding the pursit of memory techniques, along with detailed instructions on how to best memorise the deck of cards among other things. It also has a PAO generator section to allow the user to create their own memory tool to beat the game.

## Further Testing

### Manual Testing
* The website was tested on multiple web-browsers including Safari, Chrome, Firefox and Brave.

* The website was viewed on multiple devices with varying screen sizes. These include multiple iPhone 11's, an iPad air, an iPad pro, a 16 inch Macbook pro and a 13 inch Acer laptop.

* All links and pages were tested thoroughly across various browsers and screen sizes.

* Family members trialled the website on their own devices to both give feedback and look for bugs. 

### Known Bugs
* On my current version of Safari browser, some of the buttons are slightly misaligned compared to Google Chrome.
* On the iPhones that I tested the site on, the sound files all work perfectly for their first play, however subsequent plays have the very start clipped off. This is a minor issue and is only noticeable when looking for it.
* In the console, the following error message is displayed: "Error with Permissions-Policy header: Unrecognized feature: 'interest-cohort'.". From my research this appears to be an issue with Github Pages.
![Console Error Message](/assets/readme-images/console-error-msg.png)

### Notable Solved Bugs
* After first deploying my site to Github pages, when the game was started and the poker theme was introduced, on ipads the entire interface of the game would rotate and become unusable. This only happened on iPad, not on any phone or computer, however it was present on multiple iPads. 
This fix for this turned out to be a CSS rule to rotate the background image of the Nav and Footer by 90 deg. I did this to change the alignment of the wood grain in the image, however it seemed the iPad misinterpreted this as "Rotate the nav and footer 90 deg". This is now solved.

* On certain screen sizes the cards would become misaligned when flipped. I initially tried to fix this through very tedious testing of media queries to compensate at different screen sizes. This was not an ideal solution. After much testing I found that by using "Scalex(-1)" instead of "Translatex(-100%)" the cards correctly alligned.

## Accessibility and Performance
---
The project was tested using both [lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse) and [Wave](https://wave.webaim.org/) to check the overall performance and accessibility of the project.

The [Wave](https://wave.webaim.org/) report revealed no errors, and just a few advisory alerts for things such as "potentially erroneous alt text." I investigated all of these and found no issue with them.
Wave results can be viewed here:

[Memory Tips](assets/readme-images/wave-memory-tips-min.png)
[How to play](assets/readme-images/wave-how-to-play-min.png)

The [lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse) report was positive for all areas, particularly on the main game page.
